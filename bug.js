This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with custom camera configurations.  The problem is that the camera preview doesn't render correctly or at all, even when the camera appears to be initialized successfully. This is often coupled with no errors being thrown in the console.  The issue seems to be related to a combination of specific camera settings and the way Expo handles asynchronous operations within the camera component.
